~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An automatic configuration tool is available at:

To setup Source SDK with Adrenaline Gamer 2 manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Make sure Source SDK is not running.

2) Locate the file GameConfig.txt in your \sourcesdk\bin\orangebox\bin\ folder

3) !IMPORTANT! Take a backup of the above file in case of mistakes.

4) Copy the text below the line and replace [YOUR STEAM DIRECTORY] with the full path to steam and [YOUR STEAM USERNAME] with your steam username. 
Tip: you can use search and replace in your text editor

5) Paste the amended text into your GameConfig.txt as a new game. 
Tip: in a default gameconfig.txt it should go just before this at the end of the file:

	}
	"SDKVersion"		"3"
}

6) Create the folder for storing your ag2 maps in \sourcesdk_content\ag2\mapsrc\

7) Start Source SDK, if everything has gone OK you should now be able to choose Engine Version: The Orange Box / Current Game: Adrenaline Gamer 2

8) Happy mapping!
