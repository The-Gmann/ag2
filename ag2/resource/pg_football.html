<h2>Football</h2>
<p>
This is a 2 teams based mod : blue and red. The objective for each team is to score a goal by throwing the ball that is located in the middle of the map to the ennemy base. <br>
<br>
You spawn with the gravgun. You can pick up the ball from an ennemy by either kicking him with your crowbar/stunstick or by pushing him when using the gravgun. The ball carrier cannot bunnyhop so you are encouraged to throw the ball to your teammates to go faster.
