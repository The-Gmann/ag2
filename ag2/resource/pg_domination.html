<h2>Domination</h2>
<p>
The objective for each team is to get the neutral flag which is located in the middle of the map and hold it as much as it can. The winning team is one that held the flag the longest amount of time. <br>
<br>
You spawn with the gravgun, crowbar/stunstick, pistol, smg1 and  2 grenades in Regular (0 grenade in Pro). Pick up weapons and ammunitions that are located in the map to be stronger. Pick up health kits to cure yourself and armor kits to strengthen your protection suit.
