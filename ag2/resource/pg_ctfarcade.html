<h2>Capture The Flag Arcade</h2>
<p>
This is a 2 teams based mod : blue and red. Each team has one flag. The objective for each team is to get the flag from the other team and return it to its base without having its own flag captured. Therefore, you need to defend your flag and attack the other team base to get their flag. <br>
<br>
If an ennemy gets your flag and you kill him, then the flag will be dropped  at the place where the ennemy has been killed. You need to run to your flag to make it spawn at your base wherever you are in the map. <br>
You can put your flag on your back by using your <b>Reload</b> key.<br>
<br>
The team that captures and secures the ennemy flag in its base scores one point. The winning team is the team that scores the biggest amount of points. <br>
<br>
You spawn with all weapons (2 grenades in Regular, 1 grenade in Pro), full armor (and the Longjump module in Promod). You can pick up ammunitions if required. Also, you can pick health kits to cure yourself and armor kits to strengthen your protection suit. Egon is not allowed in this game mod.
