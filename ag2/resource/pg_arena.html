<h2>Arena</h2>
<p>
This is a duel based mod in which two players are facing each other. The winner scores one point and plays against the next player in the waiting list. The looser is going to the end of the waiting list.<br>
<br>
You spawn with all weapons (2 grenades in Regular, 1 grenade in Pro), full armor (and the longjump module in Promod). You can't pick up additional ammunitions, health kits or armor. Egon is not allowed in this game mod.
