<h2>Last Team Standing</h2>
<p>
This is a round based mod which means that you don't respawn when you are killed. The winning team is the one that has at least one player still alive in the game.<br>
<br>
You spawn with all weapons (2 grenades in Regular, 1 grenade in Pro), full armor (and the longjump module in Promod). Egon is not allowed in this game mod.
