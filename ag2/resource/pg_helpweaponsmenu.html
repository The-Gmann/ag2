<h2>This panel is weapons oriented. For each weapon, you can set the following parameters:</h2>
<p>
- <b>Allowed</b> : if checked, weapon is allowed, if not weapon is not allowed in your gameplay<br>
<br>
- <b>On Spawn</b> : if checked, a player spawns with the weapon by default, if not, a player spawns without this weapon<br>
<br>
- <b>Damage</b> : amount of damage applied to armor/health. <br>
<br>
- <b>Radius</b> : only for splash damage weapons. This value determines the radius of the explosion which means all players that are out of the sphere defined by the radius won't be impacted by the explosion. <br>
<br>
- <b>Spread</b> : cone of shoot. The lower it is, the more precise it is. <br>
<br>
- <b>Headshot factor</b> : in case of headshot, damage value is multiplied by this factor.<br>
<br>
- <b>Armor ratio</b> : indicates the ratio of damage which is applied to health. Remaining is applied to armor. You have to take care of this parameters as it is very important for your gameplay. For instance, if you set it to 20% then this means that 80% of the damages will be handled by your armor and the remaining damages (20%) will be handled by your health. Of course, if the player has not enough armor or even no armor protection at all then the portion of damages that should have been subtracted to the armor will be subtracted to the health.<br>
<br>
- <b>Deployment time</b> : time in seconds to use a weapon<br>
<br>
- <b>Other headshot factor</b> : mainly applies to object launched to head of an ennemy.<br>
