<h2>Warball</h2>
<p>
This is a 2 teams based mod : blue and red. The objective for each team is to score a goal by throwing the ball that is located in the middle of the map to the ennemy base. <br>
<br>
You spawn with the gravgun, crowbar/stunstick, pistol, smg1 and 2 grenades in Regular (0 grenade in Pro). Pick up weapons and ammunitions that are located in the map to be stronger. Pick up health kits to cure yourself and armor kits to strengthen your protection suit.
